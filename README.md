# hi! welcome to my repo. 
## my name is sanaa imami and i'm a rising senior at the lab schools. 
i intend to double major in **psychology** and **middle eastern studies**. 
i’ve taken a rudimentary cs course before. here are some topics we spent time learning about:
* [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform))
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)

i remember a bit of these topics, but not enough to apply in a practical setting. 
i’m excited to expand upon my very limited CS knowledge in the next few weeks!
